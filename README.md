Conducted statistical analysis on the Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) questionnaire dataset using PSPP.

### ✔️ Tasks Completed:
- Imported and cleaned data (ODS and CSV) in PSPP
- Converted categorical data (e.g., MobileUser) to numeric
- Performed One-Way ANOVA to examine the effect of Age on user engagement (A3)
- Performed Two-Way ANOVA (GLM) to study interaction effects of Age and MobileUser on A2
- Interpreted descriptive stats, Levene's test, and significance values (p-values)

### 🔍 Conclusion:
The current sample (N = 25) showed no statistically significant differences across age groups or mobile usage for most AR application questions. More data is recommended for deeper insights.
